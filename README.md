This repository showcases a common yet subtle bug in Julia related to floating-point precision. The `myfunction` calculates the square of a number, handling positive, negative, and zero inputs. While seemingly correct for integers, floating-point comparisons can lead to unexpected results due to the inherent limitations of floating-point representation. The solution demonstrates how to mitigate this issue using a tolerance value for comparisons.
